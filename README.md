# Red Panda Restaurant
Bootstrap website for a local takeaway/restaurant,  in which designed, developed and currently maintain alongside their social media & google business accounts. 

**Disclaimer** This site was initially developed in 2015, I would like to think my development & design skills have significantly improved since then. The  project I would still consider my most successful project due to being able to visualise the success  it brought the company, alongside their social accounts.
