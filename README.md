# Red Panda Restaurant
Bootstrap website for a local takeaway/restaurant. I developed and designed the site alongside establishing their social media & google business accounts. All of these I currently contribute towards maintaining.

**Disclaimer** This site was initially developed in 2015, I would like to think my development & design skills have significantly improved since then. The  project I would still consider my most successful project due to being able to visualise the success  it brought the company, alongside their social accounts.
